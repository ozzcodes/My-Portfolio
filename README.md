  * Used ETL pipelines to configure the datasets into a centralized location using Python and SQL. 
* Created plans for managing customer freight in logistics industry with a Transportation Management System (TMS); worked with third party EDI and API contractors for a 'live' look at customers freight
* Developed an employer's intranet for operational purposes available to necessary employees, intranet included:
  * Company customer's along with all their contact details and lead point of reference
  * Assigned sales personnel to specific customers for references along with all business details

### Personal Projects

* Utilizing Python and its scientific libraries, I created an analysis for suggesting a new bar location in Boston, MA.
   * Analyzed location data by webscraping Boston neighborhood information along with utilizing FourSquare's API in order to reference
     the Boston location data and local businesses.
   * I utilized tools such as folium, Google Geocoding API, FourSquare API, k-means clustering algorithm, bar-charts, pandas, numpy, shapely (to name a few).
   * I published my analysis and findings on Medium.com, you may view the link <a href="https://medium.com/@ajwaldro/analyzing-location-data-for-suggesting-a-bar-location-data-science-with-python-760ea871f78f?source=friends_link&sk=6d3d41c5f08d49db6926aac515b12e92">here</a>
* Created a malloc function library similar to that built into Linux packages
* Recreated a 'cat' function also a popular command within the Linux terminal
* Testing Suit for the DMTCP coordinator -> used to stress-test the PID name spacing implementation
* Created interactive blog by adding the Bottle Python framework to MongoDB  - Blog site stores its data on a MongoDB dataset, while the Bottle framework is used for the interface and the overall logic of the website
* Created multiple game replica's using programming languages such as Python and Racket
